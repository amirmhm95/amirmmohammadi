👋 Hi! I'm Amir, a doctoral researcher in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University. My passion is developing AI-driven solutions for a range of applications in biomedical and audio. I like to approach a challenge from the ground up, making each solution to the problem at hand and customize it. My very recent experiences were in transformer-based efficient transfer learning and physics-informed modeling, and generative AI.

## 🔬 Research

- **AI in Digital Health:** Physiological time-series analysis to improve diagnostic and predictive healthcare via HW/SW approach to help make health more accessible and also with reduced ground truth.
- **Efficient Transfer Learning:** Leveraging transformer architectures for cross-domain model adaptation for downstream data. Especially useful for edge-devices with constrained resources.

## 🎓 Education

**Doctor of Philosophy, Electrical and Computer Engineering**  
*Texas A&M University*  
Sept. 2022 – Present

## 🌍 Beyond the Lab

I like reading and watching mystery books and movies. I love spending time alone and also with family/friends. In sports, I like soccer. Recently, I have been into concepts about the world and human.
