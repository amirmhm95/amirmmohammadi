👋 I'm Amir, a doctoral researcher in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University. My research involves developing AI-driven solutions for a range of applications in health and remote monitoring. Most recently I have worked on efficient transfer learning of foundation models, physics-informed neural networks, and generative AI. I like to approach challenges simply from the ground up, understanding fundamentals, leveraging SOTA, and customizing each solution to the problem at hand.

## 🔬 Research

- **AI in Health:** Physiological time-series analysis for accessible, low-label diagnostic and predictive healthcare using integrated HW/SW pipelines.

- **Efficient Transfer Learning:** Transformer-based PETL methods that enable cross-domain adaptation on resource-constrained edge devices.

- **Open-Source & Publications:** please see my CV for links to codes and papers.

## 🎓 Education

**Doctor of Philosophy, Electrical and Computer Engineering**  
*Texas A&M University*  
Sept. 2022 – Present (expected Fall 2026)

## 🌍 Beyond the Lab

I enjoy mystery books and movies. I follow football whenever I can. Lately I have been exploring philosophy in my free time.
