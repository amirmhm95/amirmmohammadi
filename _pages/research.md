## Research Interests
Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Time-Series Analysis, Computer Vision, Parameter Efficient Transfer Learning

## Current Research Projects

### Deep Learning Methods for Time-Series and Computer Vision
Developing deep learning architectures for the analysis and interpretation of time-series data and computer vision tasks. Especially, to improve sound classification using foundation transformer models and parameter-efficient fine-tuning with histogram layers.


## Past Research Projects

### Physiological Signals Analysis and Prediction with AI Algorithms
Utilized AI models and physics-informed neural networks to analyze and predict cardiovascular dynamics from physiological time-series signals, significantly reducing the need for extensive ground truth data.

### Low-Power Sensor for Human Mental Stress Diagnosis
Designed and implemented a low-power sensor system for diagnosing human mental stress. This project involved microcontroller programming, schematic and PCB design, and data collection from human subjects using machine learning algorithms for high-accuracy stress detection.
